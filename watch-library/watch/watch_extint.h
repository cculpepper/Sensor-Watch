/** @addtogroup buttons Buttons
  * @brief This section covers functions related to the three buttons: Light, Mode and Alarm.
  * @details The buttons are the core input UI of the watch, and the way the user will interact with
  *          your application. They are active high, pulled down by the microcontroller, and triggered
  *          when one of the "pushers" brings a tab from the metal frame into contact with the edge
  *          of the board. Note that the buttons can only wake the watch from STANDBY mode (except maybe for the
  *          ALARM button; still working on that one). The external interrupt controller runs in
             STANDBY mode, but it does not runin BACKUP mode; to wake from BACKUP, buttons will not cut it,

/// @{
/** @brief Enables the external interrupt controller for use with the buttons.
  * @note The BTN_ALARM button runs off of an interrupt in the the RTC controller, not the EIC. If your
  *       application ONLY makes use of the alarm button, you do not need to call this method; you can
  *       save ~5ÂµA by leaving the EIC disabled and only registering a callback for BTN_ALARM.
